"It would not change my perspective because what I take into account is how users understand the ADAS technology. A firm that markets its ADAS technology as ""autopilot"" is pushing customers to believe that a lower level of attention is possible (compared to a technology branded as ""copilot""). What is relevant from risk perspective is how users understand the technology and the communication should be unmistakably clear to them (rather than to underwriters). In other words it is not underwriters that have to understand the real capabilities of the technology, but rather the users.","does not fall under underwriting, transparency,label does not matter"

"Knowing that it‚Äôs only a level 2 increases the level of participation of the driver into driving, hence reduce the sense of safety that an ‚Äòautopilot‚Äô may convey","label matters, transparency"
"increases because I feel like the capacity of the systems are wrongly inflated by being wrongly labelled (e.g. autopilot here, where actually not autonomous)","label matters"
"The risk assesment should be on the performance independently on the labelling","label does not matter (SAE more important),label does not matter"
"if the driver of a car (wrongly) believes that his/her car is more autonomous than it actually is, driver may delegate too much of the driving to a car that is actually not autonomous enough, therefore increasing accident frequency","label matters"
"If I as a primary insurer UW driver policy, I can decrease the premium as the Autopilot liability will be with another insurer. Or the opposite if I insure the firm itself","label matters"
"Systems are Level 2, independently from their name, meaning the driver remains the main responsible.","label does not matter (SAE more important),label does not matter"
"The car's potential of reducing frequency of accidents and/or mitigate severity (but not always)","label matters"
"It will increase the risk estimates if the system is labelled to do something that it cannot do","label matters"
"Because based on the study it could increase the probability of legal actions","label matters"
"For the same level of liability in a claim, costs may be higher if the system is labelled autopilot due to this bias","label matters"
"I would increase the risk for ""autopilot"" labeled system because they seems to lead the driver to pay less attention to the road, relying too much on the autopilot itself (overestimating the autonomous capabilities of the car). Anyway, I would perform a statistical analysis to accurately measure this effect","label matters"
"Increase since, given the same level of ADAS, vehicles labeled as 'autopilot' had higher liability ascriptions","label matters"
"I guess ADAS can help in preventing incidents","adas benefits,label does not matter"

"Benefit coming from ADAS efficacy","adas benefits,label does not matter"
"If the label ""autopilot"" increase the likelihood for the vehicle to be declared responsible of the claim, it will increase the risk premium of that vehicle compared to another vehicle with the same characteristics, but with a different label","label matters"
"for me the risk assessment would be the same, coming from the auto insurance world I am already aware of these distinctions and as such it oes not make a difference to me","label does not matter (SAE more important),label does not matter"
"Increase due to a larger liability of the firm in disclosing info","label matters"
"Most of the general public is not aware of the technical limitations of ADAS systems. Names such as Autopilot or Copilot could bring to the buyer a false sense of security and safety, often beyond the real capabilities of the system it self. It is only normal that such level of mislabeling is going to reduce trust in these Systems, hence increasing the risk estimates","label matters"
"I believe it is safer","adas benefits,label does not matter"
"It doesn't affect the estimated insurance risk, which should be based only on observed data","label does not matter (SAE more important),label does not matter"
"If we cannot trust what the firm discloses, then the risk is higher and need to be mitigated","label matters"
"While the ""true"" underlying frequency risk of an accident caused by these systems is unchanged by the labelling, the liability/severity component is influenced by the pure labeling/naming of the product, therefore it can increase the size of claims (and needs higher risk estimates)","label matters"
"no increase or decrese, rather differentiate between different labeling of ADAS","label matters"
"The presence or absence of ADAS does not currently impact the determination of liability in an accident","label does not matter (SAE more important),label does not matter"
"If the firm is unwilling to be more transparent, we as reinsurance markets should continue to be as conservative as possible when underwriting this class of automobile.","label matters, transparency"

"1) can't access the google doc on company computer, by the way; 2) Maybe increase product liability risk estimates. There's not much other info to go off of for these cases, so judgments like that can help","label matters"
"Labeling does impact risk","label matters"
"Increase due to manufacturers not being transparent and likely overestimating ADAS automation for better sales","label matters, transparency"
