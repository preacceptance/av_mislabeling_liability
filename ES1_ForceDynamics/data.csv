Participation is voluntary 

It is your choice whether or not to participate in this research. If you choose to participate, you may change your mind and leave the study at any time. Refusal to participate or stopping your participation will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.



What is the purpose of this research? 

The purpose of this research is to examine human judgments about automated vehicles. All data from this experiment are gathered for scientific purposes and will contribute to our eventual understanding of brain and visual function. These data may be published in scientific journals so that other researchers may have access to these data.



How long will I take part in this research? 

Your participation will take approximately 3 minutes to complete.



What can I expect if I take part in this research? 

As a participant, you will be asked to look at images presented on a video display and give responses with key presses or movements of a mouse pointing device. Your response may involve responding as quickly as you can, memorizing what you saw, making a judgment, or completing a questionnaire. You will also be asked to complete a demographics form.



What are the risks and possible discomforts? 

If you choose to participate, the effects should be comparable to those you would experience from viewing a computer monitor for 15 minutes and using a mouse or keyboard, e.g., eye fatigue. You are free to take breaks throughout the session. 



Will I be compensated for participating in this research? 

You will be compensated $0.60 for this study. You will still receive payment if you withdraw early.



If I take part in this research, how will my privacy be protected? What happens to the information you collect? 

Your participation in this experiment will remain confidential, and your identity will not be stored with your data.



If I have any questions, concerns or complaints about this research study, who can I talk to? 

The researcher for this study is Julian De Freitas who can be reached at 626.559.6401; #161 Morgan Hall, 15 Harvard Way, Boston MA, 02163; jdefreitas@hbs.edu. If you have questions, concerns, or complaints,
